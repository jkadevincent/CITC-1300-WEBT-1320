            <h2>The Creation </h2>
            <p>When Japan's most famous wrestler and promoter Antonio Inoki departed from the Japan Pro Wrestling Alliance, all eyes were on his next move. On, January 13, 1972, Inoki founded New Japan Pro-Wrestling so that professional wrestling in Japan could finally get the respect it deserved. On March 6 of the same year, NJPW hosted their first event in Tokyo and began to attract more fans. Over the next ten years, Inoki helped lead New Japan to higher levels and eventually launched its own governing body, the International Wrestling Grand Prix. New Japan Pro-Wrestling was lifted to major proportions in 1983 as Hulk Hogan, American pro wrestling star, became the first person to hold the IWGP Heavyweight Championship by beating Inoki and instantly elevating NJPW and its title. The history of NJPW is filled with collaborations between the NWA and WCW during this time and even AEW during modern times, all of this due to the reach of Inoki. Antonio Inoki is and will always be one of the most legendary figures in pro wrestling history because of what he did for New Japan and professional wrestling on a global scale.   </p>
            <h2>January 4 in the Tokyo Dome</h2>
            <p>The January 4 Tokyo Dome Show is New Japan's premier annual event and is the largest pro wrestling event that takes place outside of the United States. The people of Japan treat this event like their own Super Bowl or WrestleMania. NJPW has ran a show in the Tokyo Dome on January 6 every single year since 1992, making it their longest running event in the promotion's history. Since 2007, New Japan's Wrestle Kingdom in Tokyo Dome has been the events name and it can be watched via Pay-Per-View. The attendance record in the event's history came in 1993 when 63,500 fans packed into the historic venue and watched Fantastic Story in Tokyo Dome. New Japan's annual event has produced some of the greatest matches the world of pro wrestling has ever seen. According to Cagematch: The Internet Wrestling Database, three of the top ten wrestling matches in history have taken place on January 6 inside of the Tokyo Dome.  </p>
            <h2>Modern Day</h2>
            <p>The current day product of New Japan is one filled with collaborations and partnerships. Since 2022, NJPW and AEW have ran a Pay-Per-View known as Forbidden Door, an event that combines the talent from both promotions and puts on some of the best matches we've seen in recent memory. Also announced in 2022, New Japan made its way back on American and Canadian television by securing deals with AXS TV and Fight Network. If these channels are not available where you are, you can subscribe to NJPW WORLD where you can watch live and on-demand New Japan programming. They do not run their shows on set days like you'll see with most big name promotions, rather they base their shows off of venue availability and keep fans updated on when to catch them. NJPW has also made partnerships with TNA and Pro Wrestling Noah, another Japanese wrestling promotion, and have worked with both companies for multiple shows since 2021. In a world that has not been the same since Inoki's death in 2022, New Japan is doing everything in their power to remain the top promotion outside of the United States.  </p>
