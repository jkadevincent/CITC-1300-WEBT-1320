            <h2>The Creation</h2>
            <p>With World Championship Wrestling closing its doors in 2001 and WWE gaining a monopoly on the pro wrestling business, the concept of TNA was born. Wrestlers Jeff and Jerry Jarrett along side wrestling minds Bob Ryder and Vince Russo created TNA when debating their futures within the industry. TNA initially ran weekly Pay-Per-View shows until being purchsed by Panda Energy International in October of 2002. Under new ownership, TNA would begin to run new weekly shows, this time on cable rather than Pay-Per-View. In May of 2004, TNA moved from their home in Nashville to Soundstage 21 at Universal Studios in Orlando. Here, they intoduced iMPACT!, their new weekly television show which featured a six-sided wrestling ring that later helped them secure a deal with Spike TV. With new hype and lots of support, TNA was able to blast onto the scene of professional wrestling by attracting some of the biggest names in wrestling history.   </p>
            <h2>TNA iMPACT!</h2>
            <p>Spike TV had just recently lost their main show, WWE Raw, back to the USA Network. Seeing the opportunity, TNA and Spike came to the agreement that TNA could use Spike TV's prime time Saturday slot for their new weekly show, iMPACT!. Two episodes were taped every Tuesday and played on Saturday nights until TNA gained more popularity and were given the prime time spot on Thursdays. On March 27, 2008, TNA iMPACT! aired live for the first time ever, broadcasting in the show's regular time slot. From January to May of 2010, TNA attempted to compete with WWE's Raw on Monday nights but quickley realized going head to head with WWE does nothing but brings your ratings down. However, the first Monday night of live TNA television saw the promotion air the return of Hulk Hogan, bringing in a whopping 4 million viewers for the first hour of the show. Between the six-sided ring, former WCW and WWE stars, and the jaw dropping matches, TNA iMPACT! will always have a special place in the history of professional wrestling.  </p>
            <h2>Modern Day</h2>
            <p>After the conclusion of their last Pay-Per-View in 2023, the company that had simply gone by Impact announced the return of a crowd favorite name, TNA. They kicked off this new era with their first U.K. tour since 2015, holding events in England and Scotland. The company was even able to host their first ever live show from Australia in New South Wales. The official name change took place in January of 2024, bringing along a new fresh feeling to the company that holds such a special place in a lot of wrestling fan's hearts. This name change also came with internal change as president of TNA Scott D'Amore, who had been with the company since 2003, was fired and replaced by Anthony Cicione, who had worked with Anthem Sports and Entertainment for sixteen years. For the first time since the early 2010's, TNA wrestling has restored a feeling that sets them up for success and puts them in the perfect position to reclaim their title as the third most popular pro wrestling promotion in the United States. </p>
