        <h2>The Birth of the Game</h2>
        <p>During the winter of 1891, a 31-year-old named James Naismith was the athletic instructor at the International YMCA Training School in Springfield, Massachusetts. Mr. Naismith was in charge of creating new and exciting ways to keep his athletes in top form while waiting for sports that are played during warmer times of the year. This led to the creation of a game that could be playable indoors and with a large number of players at the same time. Naismith wished to recreate a game he and his friends played growing up that included a ball and a horizontal opening for the ball to be tossed through. He asked the school janitor for two square boxes to be used as goals. Instead, the janitor returned with peach baskets. These baskets were nailed on opposite sides of the gymnasuim at a height of ten feet in the air. The class was then divided into teams based on height, Naismith created a rulebook, and the game of "basket ball" was born.   </p>
